# browserify-babel-setup
An example project setup for using ES6 features in any application using browserify and babel transpiler

## running
Clone the repo on your local machine: https://github.com/alexnm/browserify-babel-setup.git
Then run the following in order to make the live transpiling process work:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Proceed by changing the code in `/scripts/demo.js` and check `bundle.js` after each file save. The process works by watching for any changes in any file from `/scripts`.
